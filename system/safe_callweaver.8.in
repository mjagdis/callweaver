.TH SAFE_CALLWEAVER 8 "Jan 30th, 2010" "CallWeaver"
.SH NAME
safe_callweaver \- A wrapper to manage a callweaver server process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP 
.B safe_callweaver
.RB [\|
.IR callweaver_option \ .\|.\|.\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B safe_callweaver 
is a script that manages a callweaver server.

It allows callweaver to be started as a daemon but with a console on a
given terminal device (e.g. a virtual console).

If callweaver exits due to anything other than a normal shut down and
halt safe_callweaver will restart it, optionally sending an email alert
to one or more addresses and/or a core analysis to one or more developer
addresses. Core dumps and analyses are collected and retained in case further
investigation is required.
.SH OPTIONS
safe_callweaver passes all command line arguments to callweaver. See callweaver(8)
for details.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The behaviour of safe_callweaver may be configured through environment variables
and through /etc/sysconfig/callweaver. Options specified in the environment override
options specified in /etc/sysconfig/safe_callweaver which, in turn, override the
defaults.

.B CALLWEAVER_ARGS
.RS
A list of command line arguments that are passed to callweaver, prefixing any
others that were given as arguments to safe_callweaver.
.br
Default: empty
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_CONSOLE
.RS
Set to "yes" to run callweaver with a console. Note that even if this is not
"yes" callweaver may still have a console if the "-c" option is given either
on the command line or in CALLWEAVER_ARGS.
.br
Default: yes
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_COREDIR
.RS
The location that core files and analyses will be dumped to and preserved in.

This directory is NOT created automatically - it must already exist and be
writable by the user that callweaver is configured to run as.

The contents of this directory are NOT cleaned out automatically.

If CALLWEAVER_COREDIR is not set no core dumps are taken unless the -g
option is supplied to safe_callweaver (either on the command line or via
CALLWEAVER_ARGS). In this case core dumps will be written to the directory
safe_callweaver is run from and safe_callweaver will make no attempt to
preserve or analyse them.
.br
Default: @cwvardir@/core
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_FROM
.RS
What to put in the "From:" header of crash alert and core analysis
emails generated by safe_callweaver.
.br
Default: "no-reply"
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_MACHINE
.RS
A string to identify the reporting host in crash alert and core analysis
emails generated by safe_callweaver. This will be used prefix the "Subject:"
header.
.br
Default: $HOSTNAME
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_NOTIFY
.RS
A comma-separated list of email addresses (suitable for use in the "To:" header of an
email) which should be alerted if callweaver exits as a result of anything other than
a normal shut down.
.br
Default: empty
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_NOTIFYDEV
.RS
A comma-separated list of email addresses (suitable for use in the "To:" header of an
email) that should recieve core analyses.
.br
Default: empty
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_REPLYTO
.RS
What to put in the "Reply-to:" header of crash alert and core analysis
emails generated by safe_callweaver.
.br
Default: "no-reply"
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_SLEEPSECS
.RS
The amount of time, in seconds, to sleep before restarting callweaver after
an abnormal termination.
.br
Default: 4
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_SYSLOG
.RS
The facility to use when logging messages to syslog. If blank or unset no messages
will be logged to syslog.
.br
Default: "daemon"
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_TERM
.RS
What value to use for the TERM environment variable if safe_callweaver is configured
to run callweaver on other than the current terminal (i.e. if CALLWEAVER_TTY is set).
On Linux, if CALLWEAVER_TTY specifies a virtual console using digit-only notation
(i.e. 1, 2, 3, ... 64) then $TERM will ALWAYS be forced to "linux". If you wish to
avoid this and use some other value of $TERM specify a full path for CALLWEAVER_TTY
(e.g. /dev/tty<n>).
.br
Default: "vt102"
.RE

.B CALLWEAVER_TTY
.RS
The terminal device that callweaver should be run on. Leave blank to run callweaver
on the current tty. A digit-only value (like the default) is taken to mean a specific
virtual console. Otherwise it should be the pathname of the tty device relative
to /dev.
.br
Default: "9"
.RE
.SH FILES
.B /etc/sysconfig/callweaver
.RS
configuration for safe_callweaver
.RE
.SH BUGS
The config file should really be /etc/sysconfig/safe_callweaver but is named
/etc/sysconfig/callweaver for historical reasons.
