## Type:        yesno
## Default:     "yes"
#
# Set to "yes" to run callweaver with a console. Note that even if this is not

#
# The contents of this directory are NOT cleaned out automatically.
#
# If CALLWEAVER_COREDIR is not set no core dumps are taken unless the -g
# option is supplied to safe_callweaver (either on the command line or via
# CALLWEAVER_ARGS). In this case core dumps will be written to the directory
# safe_callweaver is run from and safe_callweaver will make no attempt to
# preserve or analyse them.

## Default:     'vt102'
#
# What value to use for the TERM environment variable if safe_callweaver is configured
# to run callweaver on other than the current terminal (i.e. if CALLWEAVER_TTY is set).
# On Linux, if CALLWEAVER_TTY specifies a virtual console using digit-only notation
# (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ... 64) then $TERM will ALWAYS be forced to "linux". If you wish to
# avoid this and use some other value of $TERM specify a full path for CALLWEAVER_TTY
# (e.g. /dev/tty<n>).

## Type:        string
## Default:     '9'
#
# The terminal device that callweaver should be run on. Leave blank to run callweaver
# on the current tty. A digit-only value (like the default) is taken to mean a specific
# virtual console. Otherwise it should be the pathname of the tty device relative
# to /dev.
CALLWEAVER_TTY='9'
