==============================================================================
1. Syntax Highlighting ~
                                                                   *cw-syntax*

CallWeaver configuration files are auto-detected if they have a path name that
matches "*/callweaver/*.conf*" and the appropriate syntax highlighting
applied based on their name. For other files, or included files with
non-standard names, you can apply syntax highlighting by setting "syntax" to
one of the values below either by hand or using a |modeline|.


==============================================================================
2. Folding ~
                                                                  *cw-folding*

By default |folding| is on when using CallWeaver syntax. Each section (a block
of text starting with [...] and ending just before the next [...]) is grouped
into a single fold, which may be opened and closed using the standard vim
commands (e.g. za).

Since folds start at a "[...]" section heading comments related to that
section should come AFTER the heading. If they preceed the heading they will
be part of the preceeding fold with one exception. Comment lines that
immediately preceed a section heading and start with ";!" will be placed
outside both the preceeding and following folds. This enables you to place
high-level comments in your configs which will be visible at all times
regardless of folding. See the sample config files for examples.

See |cw-options| below if you would prefer not to use folding.

3. Syntax Definitions ~
                                                                   *cw-syndef*


3.1. Generic Configuration Files                                     *cw-conf*
--------------------------------

The cw-conf syntax is used for all configuration files for which a more
specific syntax is not available. It provides basic highlighting and |folding|
but limited syntax checking.


3.2. callweaver.conf
--------------------
                                                               *cw-callweaver*

The cw-callweaver syntax extends the generic syntax to provide highlighting
and extended checking of the master callweaver.conf file.


3.3. extensions.conf
--------------------
                                                               *cw-extensions*

The cw-extensions syntax extends the generic syntax to provide highlighting
and extended checking of dialplan logic as used in extensions.conf.


3.4. sip.conf
-------------
                                                                      *cw-sip*

The cw-sip syntax extends the generic syntax to provide highlighting and
extended checking of the SIP configuration as used in sip.conf.


==============================================================================
4. Common Options ~
                                                                  *cw-options*
Syntax folding is on by default but can be turned off by:

    :let g:cw_no_syntax_folding = 1

before the syntax file gets loaded (e.g. in ~/.vimrc)

Historically CallWeaver has treated all kinds of sequences of characters as
strings. If you are rigorous about enclosing strings in quotes (and you
SHOULD be if you want to avoid parsing problems) you may want to add:

    :let g:cw_no_bare_strings = 1

This will limit the sort of things that are recognised outside of quotes and
will treat such things as identifiers rather than strings.
