Josh's guide to chan_exosip2!

Note chan_exosip2 is highly experimental right now... use at your own risk, it has bugs - I'm fixing them. Contributions welcome.

Before you begin you need to install the following libraries:

libosip-2.2.1:
Available at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/osip/libosip2-2.2.1.tar.gz
Installed via: ./configure, make, make install

ortp-0.7.1:
Available at http://www.linphone.org/ortp/sources/ortp-0.7.1.tar.gz
Installed via: ./configure, make, make install

libeXosip2-1.9.1-pre16:
Available at http://www.antisip.com/download/libeXosip2-1.9.1-pre16.tar.gz
Installed via: ./configure --disable-josua, make, make install

Note you may want to specify a prefix to configure.

Now that the dependencies are installed you just need to do a ./configure --with-chan_exosip2=yes in OpenPBX.
If it fails to pick up the dependencies you'll have to go back and figure out why, they may not be in an available path for example.
