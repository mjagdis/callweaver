These are known issues with CallWeaver


APP_QUEUE CDR LOGGING

  Problem
    - If having members in a queue reachable via Zap like member =>
      Zap/g1/somenumber the member is called up correctly, but the call never gets
      logged to CDR.
  
  Solution
    - To have callweaver log CDRs correctly, change this to member =>
      Local/somenumber@somecontext and add [somecontext] to your extensions.conf
      for chan_local use.

CHAN_SIP CALL COUNTER ISSUES

  Problem
    - If using call-limit in chan_sip, counters may not be decreased after end
      of call. This is documented in trouble ticket #45, see
      http://callweaver.org/ticket/45.

  Solution
    - Use dialplan logic with the GROUP and GROUP_COUNT functions intead of the
      counters.
