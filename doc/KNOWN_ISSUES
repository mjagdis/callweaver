These are known issues with CallWeaver


SPEAKUP JITTERBUFFER

  Problem
    - In some circumstances, the speakup jitterbuffer leaks memory as per call
      (http://trac.callweaver.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/244).
    - There have been reports of the speakup jitterbuffer causing threads to hang
      using 100% CPU (http://trac.callweaver.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/248).

  Solution
    Use the 'fixed' jitterbuffer implementation instead of 'speakup'


APP_QUEUE CDR LOGGING

  Problem
    - If having members in a queue reachable via Zap like member =>
      Zap/g1/somenumber the member is called up correctly, but the call never gets
      logged to CDR.
  
  Solution
    To have callweaver log CDRs correctly, change this to member =>
    Local/somenumber@somecontext and add [somecontext] to your extensions.conf for
    chan_local use.
