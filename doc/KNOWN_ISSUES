SPEAKUP JITTERBUFFER

Problem
  - In some circumstances, the speakup jitterbuffer leaks memory as per call
    (http://trac.openpbx.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/244).
  - There have been reports of the speakup jitterbuffer causing threads to hang
    using 100% CPU (http://trac.openpbx.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/248).

Solution
  Use the 'fixed' jitterbuffer implementation instead of 'speakup'
