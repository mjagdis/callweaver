The following modules use priority jumping. This should be changed to setting
variables instead and always returning zero

These are separated into two groups. Will fix and Won't fix. Since some of these
are in modules or apps that are depricated, or part of the 1.2 high priority
modules, we won't fix them.

WILL FIX
  apps/app_hasnewvoicemail.c
  apps/app_lookupblacklist.c
  apps/app_osplookup.c
  apps/app_queue.c
  apps/app_sendtext.c
  apps/app_transfer.c
  apps/app_valetparking.c
  apps/app_voicemail.c
  channels/chan_agent.c

WON'T FIX
  apps/icd/icd_bridge.c:        ICD is not part of the modules built by default,
                                and is not officially supported in in 1.2.
  channels/chan_sip.c:          Priority jumping is only used in the depricated
                                SipGetHeader application.
