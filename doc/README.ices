Icecast + OpenPBX
==================
The advent of icecast into OpenPBX allows you to do neat things like have
a caller stream right into an ice-cast stream as well as using chan_local
to place things like conferences, music on hold, etc. into the stream.

You'll need to specify a config file for the ices encoder.  An example is
included in contrib/openpbx-ices.xml

Anyway hope you like it.
